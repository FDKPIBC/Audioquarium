Hit the settings icon to add your music directory, everything else should be common sense.

Working filetypes: aac,wav,mp3,flac, probably others im too lazy to test

Please report all bugs under issues on this repo. I do check them!

### To:Do
* Metdata Editor (All the works)
* More robust sorting / Search feature within grid layout
* Full screen mode and minimized mode (You can already kinda do this with the resizable window)

### Done:
* Themes
* Album and artist sorting
* Repeat button Once/Loop

### Maybe:

* Online metadata recieving (this usually causes more problems than answers)
* Online Lyrics (much more useful)
