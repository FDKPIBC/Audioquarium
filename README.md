Hit the settings icon to add your music directory, everything else should be common sense.

Working filetypes: aac,wav,mp3,flac, probably others im too lazy to test

Please report all bugs under issues on this repo. I do check them!

### To:Do

* Metdata Editor (All the works)
* Themes
* More robust sorting and grid layout (album and artist sorting will be done soon)
* Full screen mode and minimized mode (You can already kinda do this with the resizable window)
* Repeat button Once/Loop (How did i forget this)

### Maybe:

* Online metdata recieving (this usually causes more problems than answers)
* Online Lyrics (much more useful)
